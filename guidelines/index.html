      <p>IwaOiDaiSuga Weekend is meant to be a fun, low stress event. We want to be respectful of everyone's works and preferences as we celebrate our love for this OT4!</p>

      <p>Because @iwaoidaisugawkd will be retweeting SFW and NSFW content, we ask any minors following the event on Twitter to have 'nsfw' and '#nsfwiodswknd2022' muted so that the content does not appear on their timeline. <a class="reg-ref" href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/advanced-twitter-mute-options" target="_blank">Please refer to Twitter's guide on muting words and hashtags</a>.</p>

      <p>We remind everyone that it is your responsibility to moderate your content consumption. This means utilizing mute options on Twitter and filtering in AO3 to avoid seeing content you do not like. Related, we want to remind creators that it is their responsibility to tag their work properly. The mods will do their best to only share work that is properly tagged in accordance with the <a class="reg-ref" href="/rules">rules</a> and following guidelines. </p>
      
      <h3 id="general">General Guidelines</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>There are <strong>four (4) prompt tiers per day</strong>. You may choose to use only one, or even mix and match all four together if you want.</li>
        <li>You can find our version of the <strong>"free day" in our bonus tier</strong>! We have one character per day for this tier. That means you can post works centered around that character, or works told through that character's POV. As always, you can combine this with other prompts or use it as a standalone.</li>
        <li>The <strong>color scheme</strong> acts as a bonus prompt for those working with visual entries. (Though, anyone is free to use the color schemes to inspire them!) Like all things, using them is completely optional.</li>
        <li>Prompts are meant to be a guide! If you think your work <strong>wouldn't fit any of the prompts, it's totally okay</strong>! We'll still be retweeting them.</li>
        <li>Use the hashtag <strong>#iodswknd2022</strong> for SFW entries or <strong>#nsfwiodswknd2022</strong> for NSFW entries and tag us at @iwaoidaisugawkd so we can promote your work!</li>
        <li>If creating NSFW content, please read the <strong><a class="reg-ref" href="#nsfw">NSFW Guidelines</a></strong> to understand what we will be retweeting.</li>
        <li>If your content doesn't get retweeted within 24 hours, <strong>send us a DM on Twitter</strong>.</li>
        <li>Late entries will be retweeted for <strong>four days</strong> after the main event.</li>
        <li>All content must be your original work. <strong>Plagiarism and any other forms of content stealing will not be tolerated</strong>.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="nsfw">NSFW Guidelines</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>NSFW entries will only be retweeted if the creator is <strong>18+</strong>. We'll only retweet NSFW entries from those who have their age in their bio.</li>
        <li>For NSFW entries, please <strong>only use the NSFW hashtag #nsfwiodswknd2022</strong> and <strong>not</strong> the SFW hashtag. This is to be respectful of minors who are following the account or browsing through the SFW hashtag. We will not engage with NSFW entries that use the SFW hashtag.</li>
        <li>As this is a dual event with SFW entries, for NSFW art entries to be retweeted, they <strong>must use third-party hosts</strong> (such as Privatter, etc) with a non-explicit preview image.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 id="content">Content Guidelines</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Please remember this event is for the <strong>polyamorous ship iwaoidaisuga</strong>. We kindly ask creators to refrain from submitting fics with other pairings where iwaoidaisuga do not get together.</li>
        <li>However, we will be accepting completely <strong>platonic content</strong> (i.e. no romantic pairings of any kind) as long as it includes all four characters interacting. </li>
        <li>Regardless if the entry is romantic or platonic, please follow the <a class="reg-ref" href="/rules">rules</a> for the proper way of tagging them as such, respectively.</li>
        <li><strong>All forms of content</strong> are welcome for this event (fics, artwork, social media AU, etc.) </li>
        <li>Works in <strong>languages other than English</strong> are welcome.</li>
        <li>All entries must be <strong>properly tagged</strong> with necessary warnings. Please see our <a class="reg-ref" href="/rules">rules</a> page for how to properly tag entries on social media platforms and AO3.</li>
        <li>For entries on AO3, you may add them to the <strong><a class="reg-ref" href="https://archiveofourown.org/collections/iods_wknd_2022" target="_blank">"IwaOiDaiSuga Weekend 2022" Collection</a></strong>. </li>
        <li>For entries on Twitter, we will be compiling all tweets into a <strong>Twitter Moment</strong> at the end of the event! </li>
        <li>Entries that fail to meet the proper tagging requirements will be removed from the collection and/or not added to the event Moment.</li>
        <li><strong>For those wishing to post anonymously</strong>, it can be done by adding the work to the Anonymous collection in addition to the event collection on AO3. <a class="reg-ref" href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/25397248" target="_blank">More details about posting anonymously can be found on AO3</a>. </li>
        <li><strong>Existing works</strong> may be submitted to the event. They are not required to fit the prompts, but if they do, please wait to reshare the work on the corresponding day.</li>
        <li><strong>There is no wrong way to interpret the prompts!</strong> (Additionally, the bonus character tier is meant to act like a free space of sorts.)</li>
        <li>While we are not prohibiting any content during this event, we will be <strong>refraining from sharing content of the following</strong> on our Twitter to be respectful of our followers:
            <ul>
              <li>Underage sex</li>
              <li>Incest</li>
              <li>Rape / Non-con (Non-consensual) / Dub-con (Dubious consent)</li>
              <li>Gore</li>
              <li>Extreme violence</li>
              <li>Any form of abuse</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
